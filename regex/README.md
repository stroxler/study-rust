# Simple Regex Engine

I was inspired by watching a
[Tsoding-daily stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MH56D5M9xSQ)
to try learning about regular expressions.

I'm hoping to make this into a project that:
- has a lexer and parser for regexes
- can compile them into state machines

I'm not actually sure how nondeterministic state
machines (with the or operator) work - the video above
didn't cover that - so I'll have some learning to do!
